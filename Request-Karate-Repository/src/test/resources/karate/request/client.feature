  To validate the status code and response

  Background: consume service

  Scenario: Check the service get method
    * def responsesGet = read('classpath:karate/request/responseGet.json')
    Given path 'users','2'
    When method get
    Then status 200
    And match response == responsesGet
    And assert response.support.text == "To keep ReqRes free, contributions towards server costs are appreciated!"
    And assert response.data.email == email
    And assert response.data.id == id
    And assert response.data.first_name == first_name
    And assert response.data.last_name == last_name
    And assert response.data.avatar == avatar
    And assert response.support.url == support
